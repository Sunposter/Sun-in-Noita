# Sun-in-Noita
A small Noita mod to add Sun to the game, made for a few friends.

Extract the folder, and put it into /Noita/mods

This mod has nothing to do with the Sun Quest in Noita, in case you found yourself here randomly.
Sorry about that, have a song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMLc89-ICro

Noita UV Maps

If you've read https://noita.fandom.com/wiki/Modding:_Making_a_custom_spritesheet then you'll have seen the section where it tells you to put `ModDevGenerateSpriteUVsForDirectory( "data/enemies_gfx" )` into your init.lua file and then run NoitaDev.exe to generate the UV map for correctly showing stains on the player etc.

This doesn't work for the current version of the game, you have to use an older build.
If you have the Steam version you should be able to download an older version of the game through the Steam client (I think).
If you have the GoG version (like me) then you'll have to pirate an older version: https://pastebin.com/yPMNnPBS
